# MCP Server for WinDbg Crash Analysis

A Model Context Protocol server that bridges AI models with WinDbg for crash dump analysis and remote debugging.

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.svnscha/mcp-windbg -->

## Overview

This MCP server integrates with [CDB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/opening-a-crash-dump-file-using-cdb) to enable AI models to analyze Windows crash dumps and connect to remote debugging sessions using WinDbg/CDB.

## What is this?

An AI-powered tool that bridges LLMs with WinDbg for crash dump analysis and live debugging. Execute debugger commands through natural language queries like *"Show me the call stack and explain this access violation"*.

## What This is Not

Not a magical auto-fix solution. It's a Python wrapper around CDB that leverages LLM knowledge to assist with debugging.

## Usage Modes

- **Crash Dump Analysis**: Examine Windows crash dumps
- **Live Debugging**: Connect to remote debugging targets
- **Directory Analysis**: Process multiple dumps for patterns

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Windows with [Debugging Tools for Windows](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/) or [WinDbg from Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pgjgd53tn86).
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Any MCP-compatible client (GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, Cline, etc.)
- Configure MCP server in your chosen client

> [!TIP]
> In enterprise environments, MCP server usage might be restricted by organizational policies. Check with your IT team about AI tool usage and ensure you have the necessary permissions before proceeding.

### Installation
```bash
pip install mcp-windbg
```


## Configuration

To make MCP servers available in all your workspaces, use the global user configuration:

1. Press `F1`, type `>` and select **MCP: Open User Configuration**.
2. Paste the following JSON snippet into your user configuration:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "mcp_windbg": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["-m", "mcp_windbg"],
            "env": {
                "_NT_SYMBOL_PATH": "SRV*C:\\Symbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This enables MCP Windbg in any workspace, without needing a local `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

> **Workspace-specific and alternative configuration**: See [Installation documentation](https://github.com/svnscha/mcp-windbg/wiki/Installation) for details on configuring Claude Desktop, Cline, and other clients, or for workspace-only setup.

Once configured, restart your MCP client and start debugging:

```
Analyze the crash dump at C:\dumps\app.dmp
```

## MCP Compatibility

This server implements the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), making it compatible with any MCP-enabled client:

The beauty of MCP is that you write the server once, and it works everywhere. Choose your favorite AI assistant!

## Examples

### Crash Dump Analysis

> Analyze this heap address with !heap -p -a 0xABCD1234 and check for buffer overflow"

> Execute !peb and tell me if there are any environment variables that might affect this crash"

> Run .ecxr followed by k and explain the exception's root cause"

### Remote Debugging

> "Connect to tcp:Port=5005,Server=192.168.0.100 and show me the current thread state"

> "Check for timing issues in the thread pool with !runaway and !threads"

> "Show me all threads with ~*k and identify which one is causing the hang"
