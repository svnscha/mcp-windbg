description: 'Comprehensive single crash dump analysis with detailed metadata extraction and structured reporting'
---

Perform comprehensive analysis of a single Windows crash dump with detailed metadata extraction, call stack analysis, and structured markdown reporting.

## WORKFLOW - Execute in this exact sequence:

### Step 1: Dump File Identification
**If no dump file path provided:**
- Ask user to provide the specific crash dump file path, use `list_windbg_dumps` to help them find available dumps.

### Step 2: Comprehensive Dump Analysis
**Analyze the specified dump file:**

**Tool:** `open_windbg_dump`
- **Parameters:**
  - `dump_path`: Provided dump file path
  - `include_stack_trace`: true
  - `include_modules`: true
  - `include_threads`: true

The `open_windbg_dump` tool automatically runs `!analyze -v` and provides initial analysis output.

If the dump is very large (>5GB) or analysis takes too long we eventually timeout. In that case, inform the user about the timeout
and tell him to wait since the analysis keeps running in the background and will complete. The most obvious reason is downloading symbols for running into a timeout here.

**Then extract additional metadata with:** `run_windbg_cmd`
- **Command 1:** `vertarget` (OS version and platform details)
- **Command 2:** `lm` (loaded modules list)
- **Command 3:** `k` (call stack)
- **Command 4:** `.time` (dump creation time)
- **Command 5:** `!peb` (process environment details)
- **Command 6:** `r` (registers)

**Then cleanup:** `close_windbg_dump`

### Step 3: Generate Structured Analysis Report

## METADATA EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
Extract and include ALL of the following for the dump file:
- **OS Information:** Build number, version, platform (x86/x64/ARM64) from `vertarget`
- **Process Details:** Name, PID, command line, working directory from `!peb`
- **Exception Information:** Code, type, address, parameters from initial analysis
- **Module Information:** Name, base address, size from `lm`
- **Call Stack:** Stack with frame numbers, modules, functions, offsets from `k`
- **Timing:** Dump creation time from `.time`
- **Memory Information:** Virtual size, working set, commit charge from `!peb`
- **Thread Information:** Thread count and details from initial analysis

## ANALYSIS DEPTH:
Provide comprehensive technical details suitable for developers to:
- Understand the exact failure mechanism
- Identify the root cause in source code
- Implement appropriate fixes
- Prevent similar issues in the future

**Always ask follow-up questions if:**
- Dump file path is not provided or unclear
- User wants specific focus areas for analysis
- Additional investigation commands are needed
- Source code context would be helpful
